===========================================
Cruise TN413 processing:

Note that the structure of this documentation comes from https://currents.soest.hawaii.edu/docs/adcp_doc/APPENDIX/txtfile_wrappers/km1001c_postproc_os38nb.html#km1001c-postproc-os38nb

The os75nb at-sea processing directory was copied from
the "proc" directory of the TN413 cruise disk.

All postprocessing is done with full codas+python (i.e. using
numpy+matplotlib)

(1) Make directory os75nb for post-procssing

- copy proc/os75nb directory from cruise disk

     (i) copy the os75nb directory to "pyproc" and rename to "postproc_os75nb_pre_mask"
     (ii) make another copy called "preproc_os75nb" for later comparison

- start editing a text file called 2023_os75nb_postproc.txt, with thecontents of os75nb/cruise_info.txt at the top.
- keep notes down below, and fill in above later
   Look at the cruise track to see what we're expecting by opening pngs under "png_archive"

(2) check accurate heading device (POSMV):
- look at figures in cal/rotate *hcorr.png for gaps
  (gaps would be red "+" signs -- there are none)

conclude: no action needed


(3) check calibration:


      (a)  look at heading correction: are there gaps? does it need to be patched?
      (b)  look at watertrack and bottom track calibrations: what can we expect?


(a)run this command, then add part (or all) of the
   record displayed, to the documetation:

      tail -20  cal/watertrk/adcpcal.out 
--> important info shortcut for the above is catwt.py


   **watertrack**  
-----------
Number of edited points:  47 out of  56

            median     mean      std
amplitude   1.0040   1.0041   0.0070
phase       0.1190   0.1088   0.3528
-----------



  ===> look at the watertrack figures


 (b) cal/botmtrk/btcaluv.out  (there is no no bottom track data)


 - action: watertrack suggests a scale factor and phase shift
    might be applied after editing 


(4) view the data


  dataviewer.py


(5) 

  - update the navigations steps and redo calibration -- get
  the directory in line with modern tools and metadata


       quick_adcp.py --steps2rerun calib --auto




Now make sure all the edits have been applied and look at the calibration

   quick_adcp.py --steps2rerun apply_edit:navsteps:calib  --auto
   tail -20 cal/watertrk/adcpcal.out

(6) Edit out any bad points or profiles. Edit out times when the ship was stationary. Edit out data beyond -5 to 5 South along 180. Edit out data below 750 meters. Apply threshold editing to reject Error Velocity > 500 mm/s and bins with Percent Good < 80. Use:


     dataviewer.py -e


Let's look at the watertrack now with catwt.py
   **watertrack**  
-----------
Number of edited points:  49 out of  58

            median     mean      std
amplitude   1.0040   1.0043   0.0071
phase       0.1150   0.1078   0.3459


(7) Apply final calibration


   There are 49 points

 # A scale factor ("amplitude") should be applied because median amplitude is greater than 0.003 from 1:

quick_adcp.py --steps2rerun rotate:apply_edit:navsteps:calib --rotate_amplitude 1.012 --auto


 # A phase correction is warranted because the median is greater than 0.1 degrees.

  quick_adcp.py --steps2rerun rotate:apply_edit:navsteps:calib --rotate_angle 0.21 --auto

   **watertrack**  
-----------
Number of edited points:   9 out of  15

            median     mean      std
amplitude   0.9970   1.0026   0.0114
phase       0.0070   0.2567   1.2205


------------

This is much improved. Median and mean amplitudes are less than 0.003 from 1 and phase median is less than 0.01. Mean phase could be elevated due to a strong outlier.

 

Look at the figures too
